# Who am I?
I am a junior studying an array of subjects including, but not limited to, writing, environmental science, and engineering. I am someone who loves to learn new things about the world and those around me. On campus, I serve as RA (residential assistant), student leader for the Writing Academy and University Lecture Series committee, and perform environmental research studying the intersections of rhetoric and critical environmental issues. I also interned at an EV startup last summer, Rivian, as an engineering intern in their battery department. In the future, I hope to use writing to make a difference in the world.   

If one were to open my phone, they would find pictures of ragdoll cats (including my own, Baby), sprawling Victorian mansions, gardens around Pittsburgh and my friends. Simple pleasures  and laughter with good people sustain me. This year, I hope to explore more of art scenes and historic neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. There is something about stumbling upon a neighborhood with rich and complex history. The further you wander and more frequent you visit, the more its story reveals itself to you. Outside my love of art and history, I am an environmentalist. I am passionate about riparian restoration, climate change, and the relationship between sustainable technology and the environment.

My current website is found here. There you can find my portfolio, resume, and contact form. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
